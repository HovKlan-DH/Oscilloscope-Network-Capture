# Oscilloscope Network Capture

A very simple oscilloscope network capture application. Primarily developed for own usage, but would be happy to know if this also works for other oscilloscopes - it _should_ work, as it uses a standard SCPI socket protocol and IEEE 488.2 standard but ...

# Confirmed working on following oscilloscopes

* Rigol DS2202A
* Siglent SDS 1104X - E
* Siglent SDS 1204X - E

# Typical ports used (I assume, but not fully sure)

* Rigol
  - Typical port is `5555` 
* Siglent
  - Typical port is `5025` 

# Requirements

* Windows 10 or newer (64-bit)
* .NET Framework 4.8.1

# Why?

The tool has been made as a helper-tool for my other project _Commodore Repair Toolbox_ (CRT), https://github.com/HovKlan-DH/Commodore-Repair-Toolbox
